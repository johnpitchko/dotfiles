# Dotfiles

Various configuration files and stuff.

This is sorta half-baked. No auto-installer so you probably have to do it manually.

Just use `ln -s <source file> <target file>` to link the file in this directory to wherever it needs to be.

So like `ln -s ~/Code/.dotfiles/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim`

# Misc notes

- Binaries required/recommended to install via Homebrew:

  1. fd
  2. wget
